package.json 
nest new nest-rest-api

/* generate a controller called items */ 
nest g controller items 


/* watch the server and update changes => usse ndoemon to constanly watch the server and update it  */
npm run start:dev

/*  "get the Hello wolrd!"  default behaviour */
localhost:3000 

localhost:3000/items  {"statusCode":404,"message":"Cannot GET /items","error":"Not Found"}


to create an endpoint we use decorator 



curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/items -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{ "name" : "Item One" , "qty" : 100 , "description" : "This is item one" }'
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/items/3  -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{ "name" : "Item One" , "qty" : 100 , "description" : "This is item one" }'




- to deal withd atabase we need a service
- generate a service 
nest g service items


@Injectable() ????????



npm i -g @nestjs/cli =? gives u the command line interface to be able to generate modules ad services

npm i @nestjs/typeorm typeorm pg @nestjs/config

in .env : list environement variables for the postgres database

use typeorm  : object relational mapper , basically conencts database through entities


prisma

for nest modules are very important : app.module.ts is a global file
app.module.ts is the main module of the app that will import other modules


https://docs.nestjs.com/modules
Modules
A module is a class annotated with a @Module() decorator. The @Module() decorator provides metadata 
that Nest makes use  of to organize the application structure

decorator is a  function that add some metadata to the current class or function 

a module can import other modules (Application Module can import USER/ORDERS/CHAT/.. Modules)
every mODULE CAN import controllers and providers


usually we orgonize modules into feature modules , so if we have an application , where we have bookmarks,
authentication logic , login , sign up , user module ( that handles logic related to the user) , database module
==? breaking down you app into modules


Modules in nestjs organizie  your app


authentication mODULE


launch our application --> bootstrap logic is inside main.ts


generate a module with nest   == > nest g module user | nest g module bookmark

when we build a nestjs application : we separate our logic into controllers and service  
Controllers
Controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses to the client.

Providers || services
responsible for executing the business logic




@Injectable({}) means it's going to be able to use the dependency injection that NestJs uses under the hood 

what are dependency injection :
    we have authService class
    we have AuthControlelr class
    usually the controller need to class AuthService class
    Controller will receive the request from the internet ( post request asking to login a user) 
    Controller will call a function from AuthService and return it's result back to the client back to the browser

    ===> to do that AuthController have to instanciate a AuthService class
    inside controller  const service = new AuthService()
    => to avoid doing that  : manage where it's created , and who manages it all we usee "dependency injection"
    => instead of our controller to actually do 

        import { Controller } from "@nestjs/common";
        import { AuthService } from "./auth.service";

        @Controller()
        export class AuthController {
            constructor() {
                const service = new AuthService();
            }
        }

        it will do  :

        import { Controller } from "@nestjs/common";
        import { AuthService } from "./auth.service";

        @Controller()
        export class AuthController {
            /* we dont need to wowrry about instanciation of AuthService and how to pass it to the controller file  
                nestjs will handle on itself , how to instanciate the authService , and how to pass it to you in that AuthCiontrolelr
            */
            constructor(private authService: AuthService) {
               
            }
        }


    dependency injection allows us to do not handle dependency management

localhost:3000/auth/signin


they are libraries like SQLITE typeORM , mongoose that allow you to connect to database
but we eill use Prisma a typescript ORM 

Prisma is a query builder, but it's so easy to use basically we define a  model

with prisma we're going to create teh database connection logic , the database module in a  way .


==> we need to create a nother module . since the databse moduel will be able to be used by auth module
(login signup) . it should be used by bookmark module , user module

==>  the databse is a new feature of our app


=> to use prisma we need to have two librariries installed => 
Prisma CLI => allow us to create our schema  and run migrations , deploy migrations into the databse , it's more of a maintenance library

Prisma client : prisma have different clients , the one we're going to use is for javascript

https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-cli/installation
npm install prisma --save-dev

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/client
npm i @prisma/client


access to prisma CLI
npx prisma init 
        ==> 
            - it will generate several files for us
            - generate .env file for the environement variables
            - it creates a postgres connection string by default 
            - generate prisma folder in thre root directory ( schema.prisma is where we will declare our models)
            (type ORM create entities place them in your logic != prisma one single place)

- dOCKER compose will automatically allow us to create and destroy docker containers 

- use the relational database postgres version 13
- database will be exported on the port 5434

https://polar-hub-a40.notion.site/docker-Kubernetes-1-177bcf589dfc47e19d5f773af037a26a 

- to launch our database

- docker compose up dev-db -d (-d is for run it in the background)

- brew install docker-compose

docker-compose up dev-db -d


docker logs 17dc51b9523a  => database system is ready to accept connections


-----------------------------
prisma will allow us to access to our local database
npx prisma --help

npx prisma migrate dev => will read schema.prisma and will generate the migrations

----------------------------------
when we use (npx prisma migrate dev) => prisma also does (npx prisma generate)

generate will create typescript types for your  schema , it creates User interfaces / classes
